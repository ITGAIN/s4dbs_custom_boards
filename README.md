# s4dbs_custom_boards
This repository stores custom dashboards for the monitoring solution speedgain for databases (speedgain.com)

This Boards can be imported / provisioned to a Grafana that is connected to a Speedgain for Databases Repository. 

All dashboards seen here are subject to be integrated into the tooling itself once in a while (only with permission of the owner). 

One folder per area (Db2, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, Linux, Windows) and one folder per dashboard is needed. Please provide a readme besides the dashboard describing the prereqs and needed collectors and minimum version of speedgain for databases for that board to be working.
